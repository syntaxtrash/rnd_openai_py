    "A: We need prompt engineering strategies to make sure GPT models work well and safely in different situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt engineering helps control what the model writes. GPT models write based on what they're told. Prompt engineering guides this process, making sure the model writes things that make sense and are right for the task..\n",

    "### Prompting Strategies:\n",
    " - Strategy 1: Write clear and specific instructions\n",
    " - Strategy  2: Give the model time to “think”\n",
    "\n",
    "These strategies and their tactics may change overtime, there could be more in the future, but these two strategies are generally good for every use case. \n",
