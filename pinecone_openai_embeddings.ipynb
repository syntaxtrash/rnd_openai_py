    "# Semantic Search with Pinecone and OpenAI\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is semantic search?**\n",
    "- Semantic search is a data searching technique which uses the intent and contextual meaning behind a search query to deliver more relevant results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lexical search vs Semantic search**\n",
    "- Semantic search aims to understand the meaning behind user queries and provide contextually relevant results, while lexical search relies on literal matching of keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pinecone Indexes**\n",
    "- Indexes in Pinecone usually refer to the data structures used to efficiently organize and search through vectors of high-dimensional embeddings. It's basically where we're going to store our vectors to be retrieved later. \n",
    "\t- There's different types of indexes that can store our vectors. In this notebook, we're going to use the free tier or the starter index. **We can only create one starter index**.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\tRead more: https://docs.pinecone.io/docs/indexes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our workflow is as follows:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Embedding and indexing:\n",
    "\t- Generate vector embeddings of our text data using the OpenAI Embedding API.\n",
    "\t- Upload these vector embeddings into Pinecone.\n",
    "2. Searching:\n",
    "\t- Pass the query text through the OpenAI Embedding API once again.\n",
    "\t- Use the resulting vector embedding as a query and send it to Pinecone.\n",
    "\t- Receive semantically similar text in response, even if they don't share any keywords with the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to setup our environment and retrieve API keys for OpenAI and Pinecone\n",
    "1. Run this command in the terminal to install Pinecone, OpenAI, and python-dotenv using pip :\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` bash\n",
    "    pip install pinecone-client openai python-dotenv\n",
    "    # This command will install Pinecone, OpenAI, and dotenv for python.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2. Run this command in the terminal to verify if the installation was successfull. \n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` bash\n",
    "    pip list\n",
    "    # This will list all the installed python packages, locate `pinecone-client`, `openai`, and `python-dotenv` packages to verify if they're successfully installed.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a `.env` file and get your API keys for OpenAI and Pinecone. \n",
    "\t- For OpenAI get your API key at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys.\n",
    "\t- For Pinecone get your API keys at https://app.pinecone.io/.\n",
    "\t- Paste the both API keys to the `.env` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` bash\n",
    "    # Your .env should  look like this. Replace the value of OPENAI_API_KEY and PINECONE_API_KEY with your actual OpenAI and Pinecone API key. \n",
