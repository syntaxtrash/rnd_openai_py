Foundational Background
Connection to Village 88

The experience gained from Village 88 and its projects laid the groundwork for Armada Logics. The founders, including CEO John Supsupin, recognized the need for a reliable offshore development center that could deliver high-quality software solutions while maintaining close collaboration with clients.
