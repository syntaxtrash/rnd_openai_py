    "# What is Embeddings?\n",
    "An embedding is a vector (list) of floating point numbers. The distance between two vectors measures their relatedness. Small distances suggest high relatedness and large distances suggest low relatedness.\n",
    "\n",
    "While embeddings and vectors can be used interchangeably in the context of vector embeddings, \"embeddings\" emphasizes the notion of representing data in a meaningful and structured way, while \"vectors\" refers to the numerical representation itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of embeddings, read more: https://www.ibm.com/topics/embedding\n",

    "\n",
    "To create an embedding, we're going to send our text string to the OpenAI embeddings API endpoint along with the embedding model name. We will use `text-embedding-3-small` model. It's one of the newest and most performant embedding models released by the OpenAI. Read more: https://openai.com/blog/new-embedding-models-and-api-updates\n",

    "1. Install the OpenAI python library and dotenv for managing our api key using pip in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` bash\n",
    "    pip install openai python-dotenv\n",
    "    # This command will install both the OpenAI python library and dotenv.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2. Verify if the installation was successfull by running this command in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` bash\n",
    "    pip list\n",
    "    # This will list all the installed python packages, locate both packages to verify if they're successfully installed.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3. Create a `.env` file and paste your OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys:\n",
    "    ``` bash\n",
    "    # Your .env file should look like this, replace the value with your actual OpenAI API key\n",
